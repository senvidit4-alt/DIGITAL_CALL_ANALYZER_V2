# MCA Cyber Dost - AI Scam Call Detector 🇮🇳

MCA Cyber Dost is a Flask-powered backend designed to detect scam calls in real-time. It uses a combination of Rule-based engines and ML models to analyze text and audio for suspicious patterns common in Indian cyber scams.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-lingual Support**: Recognizes English, Hinglish, and Devanagari (Hindi) keywords.
- **Dual STT Engine**: Uses Google Speech-to-Text with a local **Whisper** fallback for reliable audio transcription.
- **Rule-based & ML Analysis**: A hybrid scoring system that categorizes calls into **SCAM**, **WARNING**, or **SAFE**.
- **Stage Tracking**: Monitors the progression of a scam across 5 stages: Authority, Fear, Isolation, Urgency, and Extract.
- **Escape Scripts**: Provides immediate actionable advice for users based on the detected scam stage.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Audio Processing**: SpeechRecognition, OpenAI Whisper
- **ML**: Joblib (Pipeline integration)
- **CORS**: Enabled for frontend integration (Port 5173)
